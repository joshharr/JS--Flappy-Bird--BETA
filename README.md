JS--Flappy-Bird--BETA
=====================

This is the Java-Script Code for a "Flappy Bird" game I am in the process of developing

*NOTE - This code has been edited from a blog by the name of LESSMILK. In no way am I attempting to copy LESSMILK's work, I am just trying to 

develop a Flappy Bird based on his code.

Thanks!
